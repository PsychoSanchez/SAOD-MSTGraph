# SAOD-MSTGraph
MST Graph Coursework
The repository contains program, that solves a minimum spanning tree algorithm. Created as course work for structure and data processing algorithms during study in BSTU.

## About MST
A minimum spanning tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree is a subset of the edges of a connected, edge-weighted undirected graph that connects all the vertices together, without any cycles and with the minimum possible total edge weight. That is, it is a spanning tree whose sum of edge weights is as small as possible. More generally, any edge-weighted undirected graph (not necessarily connected) has a minimum spanning forest, which is a union of the minimum spanning trees for its connected components.
